## üìñ About This Project
This repository is a complete digital preservation and restoration of Backyard Monsters, Kixeye‚Äôs 2010 Flash-based strategy game. It features a reconstructed client, decompiled from original game files, alongside a custom-built server component implemented through extensive reverse engineering efforts.
The client runs on version 128.5690 and remains fully compatible with the original ActionScript 3 codebase, rendered through Adobe Flash Player. The backend is powered by Node.js, using the Koa framework, with a PostgreSQL database managed via MikroORM and written entirely in TypeScript.
This project aims to keep a piece of gaming history alive and playable for future generations.

<br>

## üöÄ How to Play
We recommend to download our game launcher which can be installed from our website's [download page](https://bymrefitted.com/downloads). This will allow you to seamlessly manage what build versions of the client you play, all from one place, without worrying about manually downloading new versions. The launcher currently supports Windows (64-bit) and Linux.
