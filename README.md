## Repo Information
We are running a lightweight [Koa](https://koajs.com/) server written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database leveraging [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), as our ORM of choice. The client is written in [ActionScript 3](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html) and uses [Adobe FlashPlayer](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) to display its content. 

This repository contains the entire modified SWF (Shockwave Flash) client files, along with the corresponding server component rebuilt from the ground up for Kixeye's 2010 Flash client, Backyard Monsters. The client is running on version 128.5690.

## üöÄ How to Play

### Linux
You can use [this script](./launcher.sh) to automatically set-up the game for you: It checks for the latest release and automatically downloads the Flash Player if not found.

### Manual Installation
We recommend running the game in the native Flash Player projector, which is linked below. Once you have downloaded and opened the Flash Player, click on `File > Open` and select the game file. You can find the game file under our [latest releases](https://github.com/bym-refitted/backyard-monsters-refitted/releases).

[Flash Player for Windows](./flashplayer_32.exe)

[Flash Player for Mac/Linux](https://archive.org/download/flashplayer32_0r0_363_win_sa)
