# Contributing to Backyard Monsters Refitted

Welcome to the Backyard Monsters Refitted development team!

## üìù Development Guidelines

We recommend all developers compile the client application using VSCode, as outlined in our [Wiki](https://github.com/bym-refitted/backyard-monsters-refitted/wiki). This allows for seamless development and makes it easy for us to track your changes.

### Code Standards
We expect developers to follow the coding style and standards already established in the codebase:
- Use the ORM provided for database queries and operations
- Utilize proper TypeScript features (interfaces, type definitions)
- Use JSDoc comments over single-line comments
- Keep logic modular and concise
- Understand what you're writing and the problem it solves

Remember, other developers will need to work with your code, so please make it readable and maintainable. **We will not accept subpar pull requests.**

### Communication
Communication is key! We have a Discord channel where developers can ask questions and solve issues together. Please check our Wiki first, then ask if you're unsure about anything.

## üîÄ Pull Requests

### Branch Setup
- Checkout directly from the branch you intend to make changes to
- Use proper branch naming: `feature/your-change`, `bugfix/issue-description`, `hotfix/urgent-fix`

### Requirements
- **Pull Request Description Required**: Your PR must include a detailed description outlining:
  - What changes you made
  - Why the changes were necessary
  - How you tested the changes
- Include meaningful commit messages
- **DO NOT** include any `.swf` files or game binaries - changes should only be in `src`

### Feature Tags
Use appropriate tags for your changes:
- `experimental` - New features in testing
- `bugfix` - Bug fixes
- `performance` - Performance improvements
- `security` - Security-related changes
